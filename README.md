> [!NOTE]
> This is just a POC to test `rqlite` on a local maschine & it's ability to make `sqlite` the ðŸ«… of lightweight `RDMS`.

# Usage:

`docker compose up`

## enter `exec` the leader `node1`

- `docker compose exec rqlite-node1 sh`
- `rqlite` to enter the rqlite shell
- execute a few SQL statements -> https://rqlite.io/docs/cli/#example

## see the replication

- `docker compose exec rqlite-node2 sh`
- `cd /root/backup`
- `rqlite` to enter the rqlite shell
- `.backup bak.sqlite3` from https://rqlite.io/docs/guides/backup/#backing-up-rqlite

ðŸ¥³ now in the folder `backup-node1` you should see the file `.backup bak.sqlite3` which has all the data create in `rqlite-node1` replicated âœ…

# RQLite TS Client

https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite#query

This project has an added `bun.sh`/TS application (`src/bun`) in a `docker`-container.
It includes an Adapter to streamline the default `bun.sh` SQLite implementation with the same interface for `rqlite` and it's provided HTTP API.

```js
/**
 * @module RqliteDatabase
 * TypeScript implementation of rqlite database abstraction similar to Bun's SQLite API.
 * Provides asynchronous methods for running SQL queries and managing prepared statements.
 */

```

# Teardown

TODO: find out why but if you keep the persistant volumes it had issues, so we delete them to clean up

`docker compose down --volumes`
